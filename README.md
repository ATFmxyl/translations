# Translations
Repo of translations

## Steps
1. Fork this repo.
2. If you have already forked and want to update a translation, always update your local repo. Check this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository
3. For each app, `strings.xml` is the default english strings. To submit a new translation, make a new strings file with locale code. For example, if you are making turkish translation make a file `strings-tr.xml` and put your translations in that file.
4. After translating, submit a pull request.

Thank you.
