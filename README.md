# Translations
Repo of translations

## Steps
1. Fork this repo. Get it 
2. If you have already forked and want to update a translation, always update your repo. Check this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20984802/how-can-i-keep-my-fork-in-sync-without-adding-a-separate-remote/21131381#21131381
3. For each app, `strings.xml` is the default english strings. To submit a new translation, make a new strings file with locale code. For example, if you are making turkish translation make a file `strings-tr.xml` and put your translations in that file.
4. The original `strings.xml` and your `strings-xx.xml` must be under the same directory.
5. After translating, submit a pull request.

Thank you.
